### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

With this challenge I learned to create a design adapted to screens of different devices.

During practice I made use of the option media queries.

Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site or app depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser viewport width).

```css
@media screen, print { ... }
```


### Continued development

After this challenge, I think I have to practice with media queries.


### Useful resources

- [Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This helped me show the adaptive design.
